## üîπ Clinical Operations Optimization Assistant

* **Intent**: Help hospitals and public systems identify treatment protocols that lower cost per admission while maintaining or improving care quality
* **Details**:

  * Focuses on optimizing cost **during admission**, not avoiding readmissions
  * Accepts queries like: ‚Äúwhat is the lowest-cost treatment protocol for RSV in elderly patients?‚Äù, ‚Äúhow to manage diabetes inpatient care with minimal cost impact?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhich wound care method speeds up recovery **and reduces material use?‚Äù**
  * Assistant responds with:

    * Evidence-backed, cost-efficient protocols
    * Comparative outcomes (e.g., healing time, complication rates)
    * Source citations and confidence levels
  * Enables:

    * **Hospitals** to apply protocols that reduce LOS (length of stay) or material use (e.g. stitching techniques that lead to faster healing)
    * **Elderly care improvements that reduce nurse rounds, re-treatments**
    * **Governments/insurers** to model savings at scale
    * **Patients** to understand value-based care options
* **Dependencies**: Protocol-outcome mapping, RCT ingestion, clinical efficiency models
* **Persona**: HospitalOpsViewer, PayerAnalyst, ClinicalLead
