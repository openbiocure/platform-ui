# Code Rules

## Source Code Scanning
- Scan the source code every time before generating answers or making changes
- Always read relevant files to understand the current codebase state
- Use semantic search and file reading tools to gather context before proceeding

## Visual Identity Adaptation
- Always read and adapt visual_identity.md before executing any design or UI changes
- Ensure all color schemes, typography, and design elements follow the established brand guidelines
- Use the specified color palette from visual_identity.md
- Apply Montserrat font family for typography
- Maintain the laboratory bottle + robot + data analysis logo concept
- Preserve the established visual identity when redesigning components

## Security Requirements
- Always read security.md before developing any API between frontend and backend

## Data Model Requirements
- **NEVER create data models, database schemas, or backend structures without explicit discussion and approval**
- All data models must be discussed with the user before implementation
- No assumptions about data structure, relationships, or backend architecture
- Wait for explicit instructions before creating any backend components
